# TrafficAZ

TrafficAZ is an intelligent, voice-activated traffic monitoring and reporting application designed for drivers. It allows users to:

* Receive real-time traffic conditions
* Report traffic congestion using voice commands
* Get spoken traffic alerts and route suggestions
* Use hands-free voice interaction while driving

TrafficAZ uses geolocation, speed metrics, and voice command recognition to provide a seamless and safe driver assistant experience.

## Architecture Overview

TrafficAZ uses a client-server architecture:

* **Frontend**: Built with React Native + Expo, integrates geolocation, microphone, and text-to-speech APIs
* **Voice Services**: Wake-word detection, intent parsing, voice recognition and feedback
* **Backend**: Python FastAPI for handling API requests, intent parsing, traffic estimation and reporting
* **Database**: Stores user reports, speed/location logs, alerts, and traffic analysis
